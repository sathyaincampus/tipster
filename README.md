Tip Calculator Application Using Swift

* This application shows how we calculate tip as and when we type the bill amount.
* There are 3 configured tip percentages 10, 15 and 25.
* Based on the amount entered and tip percentage selected from the Segmented control, the tip amount and total amount are calculated.
* Have also implemented a new view called Settings and we can enter some default tip percentage in that. On clicking the save button, it gets back to original screen and shows the defaultTipPercentage. Modal Transition is used here to show and dismiss the settings view

We have used the following UI components :

* TextField
* UILabel
* Tap Gesture Recognizer
* View
* Segmented Control
* UIViewController
